          I'm a Border Collie with a blue merle coat. Everyone confuses me with an
          Australian Shepherd, but it's understandable. I have traits
          more aligned with the Border Collie breed. I love hearding anything I can,
          running around, playing, and especially <em>staring</em>.

          <strong>My story begins in 2013.</strong> I was born, then left to fend for myself
          in the woods. Lucky for me, someone found me! Despite her best efforts,
          she was unable to find my original owners. <br>

          Let's face it, though; it was for the best. I was wet, scared,
          and covered in ticks. She took me home, removed the ticks, and gave me
          a bath. I had bitten through my tongue at some point in my adventures
          alone, but I wasn't any worse for wear. Plus, now I have a cute chip in it!
          However, this would be the start of our wonderful journey together.

          <strong>I've grown a lot since I was rescued.</strong> I live happily, and healthily
          with my Mom, and her partner. We love playing monkey in the middle with
          my favorite toys, going to the park, and taking strolls together.

          I love them very much, and they love me.
